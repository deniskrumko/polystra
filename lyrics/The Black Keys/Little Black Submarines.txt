[VERSE 1]
Little black submarines
Operator please
Put me back on the line

Told my girl I'd be back
Operator please
This is wreckin' my mind

[CHORUS 1]
Oh can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind [x2]

[VERSE 3]
Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator please
Call me back when it's time

Stolen friends and disease
Operator please
Patch me back to my mind

[CHORUS 3]
Oh can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind [x2]

[SOLO]

[CHORUS 4]
Oh can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time

I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind [x3]
