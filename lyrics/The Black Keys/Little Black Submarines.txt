Little black submarines

Oh, can it be

The voices calling me

They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow

But everybody knows
       C      D        A

Stolen friends and disease

Pass me back to my mind

Oh, can it be

They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow

But everybody knows
       C      D        A
That a broken heart is blind

That a broken heart is blind [x2]
