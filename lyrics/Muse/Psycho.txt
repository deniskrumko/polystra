[VERSE 1]
Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild
So come to me now

I could use someone like you
Someone who'll kill on my command
And asks no questions

[PRE-CHORUS]
I'm gonna make you...
I'm gonna break you...
I'm gonna make you...
A fucking psycho! [x3]

[CHORUS]
Your ass belongs to me now

[VERSE 2]
Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station
I'll improve your thresholds

I'll turn you into a super drone (super drone)
And you will kill on my command
And I won't be responsible

[PRE-CHORUS]
I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho! [x3]

[CHORUS]
Your ass belongs to me now

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
Your ass belongs to me now [x2]
