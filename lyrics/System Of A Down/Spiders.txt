[VERSE 1]
The piercing radiant moon (The piercing radiant moon)
The storming of poor June (Storming of poor June)
All the life running through her hair (Through her hair)
-
Approaching guiding light (Approaching guiding light)
Our shallow years in fright (Our shallow years in fright)
Dreams are made, winding (Dreams are made, winding)
Through my head (Through my head)

[CHORUS]
Through my head
Before you know, awake

[VERSE 2]
Your lives are open wide
The V-chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair
-
The spiders all in tune
The evening of the moon
Dreams are made, winding
Through my head

[CHORUS]
Through my head
Before you know, awake

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
Through my head
Through my head
Before you know
Before you know I will be waiting, all awake

[ENDING]
Dreams are made winding through her hair
Dreams are made winding through her hair
