Peter's pecker picked another
Pickle bearing pussy pepper,
Peter's pecker picked another
Pickle bearing pussy pepper, why?

Meeting John Dale Jr.
Winked an eye and point a finger,
Meeting John Dale Jr.
Winked an eye and point a finger, why?

A former cop, undercover,
Just got shot, now recovered,
A former cop, undercover,
Just got shot, now recovered, why?

Fighting crime, with a partner,
Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter,
Fighting crime, with a partner,
Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter, (siren).

Mine delusions acquainted,
Bubbles erotica,
Plutonium wedding rings,
Icicles stretching,
Bicycles, shoestrings,
One flag, flaggy but one,
Painting the paintings of the alive.
