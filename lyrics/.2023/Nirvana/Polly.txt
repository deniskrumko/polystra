[VERSE 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

[CHORUS]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, haven't true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[VERSE 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

[CHORUS]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, haven't true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[BREAK]
Polly said

[VERSE 3]
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct

[CHORUS]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, haven't told
Promise you, haven't true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
