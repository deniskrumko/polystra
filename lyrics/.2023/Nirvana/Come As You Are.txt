[VERSE 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[CHORUS]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[VERSE 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

[CHORUS]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[BREAK]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

[CHORUS]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria (No, I don't have a gun)

[BREAK]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

[ENDING]
Memoria
Memoria
