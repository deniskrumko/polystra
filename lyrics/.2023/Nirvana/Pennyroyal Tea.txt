[VERSE 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

[CHORUS]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

[VERSE 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

[CHORUS]
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

[VERSE 3]
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

[CHORUS]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
