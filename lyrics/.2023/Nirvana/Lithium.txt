[VERSE 1]
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you, we broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God

[CHORUS]
Yeah [x13]

[VERSE 2]
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard, but I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there and I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

[CHORUS]
Yeah [x13]

[BREAK x2]
I LIKE it, I'm not gonna crack
I MISS you, I'm not gonna crack
I LOVE you, I'm not gonna crack
I KILLED you, I'm not gonna crack

[VERSE 3]
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is everyday for all I care and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God

[CHORUS]
Yeah [x13]

[BREAK x2]
I LIKE it, I'm not gonna crack
I MISS you, I'm not gonna crack
I LOVE you, I'm not gonna crack
I KILLED you, I'm not gonna crack
