[VERSE 1]
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old

I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home

I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

[CHORUS]
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said! She said! [x4]

[VERSE 2]
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old

I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home

I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

[CHORUS]
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said! She said! [x4]

[CHORUS]
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said! She said! [x4]
She said!

Said... good
