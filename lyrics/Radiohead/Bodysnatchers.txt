#drop

[VERSE 1]
I do not. Understand
What it is. I've done wrong

Full of holes. Check for pulse
Blink your eyes. One for yes. Two for no

[CHORUS 1]
I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
-
Oooh-oooh [x2]

[VERSE 2]
You killed the sound. Removed backbone
A pale imitation. With the edges sawn off

[VERSE 2]
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
-
Oooh-oooh

[BREAK]
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century

It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in

On the lines wrapped around my face
On the lines wrapped around my face
Are for anyone else to see
Are for anyone else to see
I'm a lie

[ENDING]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... [x3]
-
I've seen it coming [x4]
