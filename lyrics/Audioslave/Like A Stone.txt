[VERSE 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[CHORUS]
In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there...
Alone! [x2]

[SOLO]

[BREAK]
And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death I will wander on

[CHORUS]
In your house I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there...
Alone! [x2]
