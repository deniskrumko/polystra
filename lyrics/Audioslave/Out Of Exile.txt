[VERSE 1]
When I first came to this island
That I called by my own name

I was happy in this fortress
In my exile I remained

But the hours grew so empty
And the ocean sent her waves

In the figure of a woman
She pulled me out to sea

[CHORUS 1]
When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away

When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away

[VERSE 2]
On the altar of a sunrise
Was a wedding in the waves

And inside her shone a young light
From her labor I was saved

Though I've traveled long in darkness
In her harvest I'm embraced

[CHORUS 2]
When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away

When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away

[SOLO]

[VERSE 3]
Now the spires and the gables
Grow in orchards to the sky

And the blessings on my table
Multiply and divide

[CHORUS 3]
When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away

When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away

Yeah, when you come down to take me home
When you come 'round you'll make me whole

Yeah, when you come down to take me home
Send my soul away [x4]
