[INTRO]
Woo-hoo [x4]

[VERSE 1]
I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing i-is
No

[CHORUS]
(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy-metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy

All of the time but I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[VERSE 2]
I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[CHORUS]
(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy-metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy

All of the time but I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[ENDING]
Yeah yeah [x3]
Oh yeah!
