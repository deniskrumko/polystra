"Song 2"

Woo-hoo [4x]

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing i-is
No

Woo-hoo
When I feel heavy-metal
Woo-hoo
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo-hoo
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Woo-hoo
When I feel heavy-metal
Woo-hoo
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo-hoo
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeah
