[VERSE 1]
I know all your flaws and most of your fears
I haven't been home a lot in the last two years

The constant absence from all my peers
The vibration still steady inside my ears

And I know you hate it, I always restate it
But I'm still so frustrated 'cause I'm the one you cheated

[CHORUS 1]
It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I don't wanna sleep here

[VERSE 2]
I hope you feel that heavy gloom
When you're all done up in a crowded room

And your life trips up over those shoes
That you paid too much for but not in dues

And I'll be watching from a distance
Wouldn't wanna miss this
Was it fake the whole time? Was it just instance?

Man, it's so personal, yet it's business
I want it to hit so close to home

[CHORUS 2]
It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I don't wanna sleep here

And I know you don't care
You've made it so clear
Swore I had no fear
Not until you came near

[BREAK]
And how much does it cost
To get you back here inside those clubs

That you love so fucking much?
Was I too harsh in my lament to you

That I fell so out of touch?
Back and forth because I can't understand how you

Control all my lust and form the words on my tongue

[CHORUS 3]
It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I don't wanna sleep here

And I know you don't care
You've made it so clear
Swore I had no fear
Not until you came near

It cuts so much deeper
Why would I wanna see her?
Only had one beer
And I don't wanna sleep here
And I know you don't care
