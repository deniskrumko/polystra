Nothing here to see
Just a kid like me
Trying to cut some teeth
Trying to figure it out

Nothing better to do
When I'm stuck on you
I'm still in here trying to figure it out

Getting hard to sleep
Blood is in my dreams
Love is killing me
Trying to figure it out

Nothing better to do
When I'm stuck on you
I'm still in here trying to figure it out

I'll let it go, cause I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to talk it out
I said I'd go, put myself on show
But I'm still trying to figure it out

I broke my shoe, tripped and fell on you
But you didn't know I planned it out
I said I'd go, yeah I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to figure it out

Nothing here to see
Just a kid like me
Trying to cut some teeth
Trying to figure it out

Nothing better to do
When I'm stuck on you
I'm still in here trying to figure it out

I'll let it go, cause I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to talk it out
I said I'd go, put myself on show
But I'm still trying to figure it out

I broke my shoe, tripped and fell on you
But you didn't know I planned it out
I said I'd go, yeah I won't see you later
And we're not allowed to figure it out
